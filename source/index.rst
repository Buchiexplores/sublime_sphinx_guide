Create Documentation with RST, Sphinx, and Sublime
#######################################################

This project captures guidelines and tips for efficiently creating
documentation using Sphinx and Sublime.

Sphinx is a tool for compiling sets of RST files into an HTML document. (You
can also use Sphinx to create many other document formats.)

Sublime is a text editor that you can set up to make writing RST very easy.

This document is geared towards content creators, not programmers.

Contributions are welcome.
