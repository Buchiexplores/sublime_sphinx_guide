Snippets
#########

Snippets are short fragments of text that you use frequently. Use snippets to
save yourself tedious typing. Snippets are smart templates that will insert
text for you and adapt it to their context.

You can associate snippets with triggers, that is, specific keystrokes.  For
example, if you configured a snippet for an RST ordered list with the trigger
``ol``, when you enter ``ul``, the following snippet is added at the cursor::

  #. Step one.

  #. Step two.

  #. Step three.

After it's added at the cursor, you can edit the snippet as needed. You can
configure the snippet so you can tab through subsequent parts of the text.

The following video demonstrates using some custom snippets for common RST structures.

Snippets are stored on your computer. To share snippets within a team, you
must manually share the snippet files.

For a good overview of snippets, see :xref:`Snippets Doc`.
